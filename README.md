## Getting Started

We started with a meeting to go over all the requirements.
After coming up with the initial flow, actors and the necessary actions, we added these to a trello for the group. This way we could keep track of who was doing what and which items still needed to be done. It also served as a guideline for the task order. 
After this was done, we could start coding. 

### What we did

* Design and implement basic dashboard
* Design and implement issue creating form
* Design and implement issue editing form
* Setup the database
* Define and implement the API routes
* Define and implement the issue model
* Define and implement the user model
* Design the issue creation form
* Design the issue editing form

### What we are currently working on

* Design the user login page
* Implement the issue creation form
* Implement the issue editing form
* Design and implement the issue detail page
* Several small fixes

## What we still need to do

* Design and implement the main issue list
* Design and implement the user profile creating/edit page
* Design and implement the comment creation form 
* Implement the login authentication
* Hosting the entire app

### Built with

* MongoDB
* Express
* React.js
* Node.js
* Password.js (was going to be used for the login authentication)

### Summary

We made a lot of progress during the week, but the issue tracker is far from completed.
The app is around 65% finished, even though there are still a few big items and multiple small things to do.
All of us have learned a lot doing this project, but there were some struggles as well. 
There is at least another few days to a week of work remaining to finish everything. 

## Deployment

* Heroku (Will be used once we deploy)
